// RS VR fists (2026-10-16, owner): one fist per hand, and they never change hands.
//   main hand   BD22's fists weapon (Melee_Attacks). Ermac's fist is drawn on it (hands.zs).
//   off hand    our off-hand weapon (RSQ_Hands, "Hands"): a fist whenever it is free. It is
//               also what does the immersive reloads, so the main gun keeps reloading by hand.
// A real punch with either controller lands BD22's own punch (MeleeStrikeNormal, or the
// berserk one), from the hand, the way the punch went. Only a fast, mostly forward blow counts,
// once per blow; the hand has to slow down before it can punch again.
// Neither fist can be moved to the other hand (WEAPON.NOHANDSWITCH).
// rsq_punch 0 turns the real punches off. Out of VR nothing here does anything.
